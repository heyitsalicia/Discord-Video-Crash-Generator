# Discord-Video-Crash-Generator
Creates a video that crashes your discord.

i forgot what i was gonna say
oh yeah
video1 is the first part of the video (non crashing)
video2 is the second part of the video, has to be atleast 0.5-1 second i think (crashing)
i suggest making video2 a higher or lower resolution than video1, trust me it'll be funny
also for the people who think im trying to rat them even though i dont know how to code one?????
i included the .bat file incase you're too scared to run the .exe
